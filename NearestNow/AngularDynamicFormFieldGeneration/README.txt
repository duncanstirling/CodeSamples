                        LARAVEL CODE SAMPLE: USE OF ANGUAR.JS

Please note nearestnow.com is a work in progress, it is at prototype stage however basic functionality does work. If you would like to employ me as a full stack Laravel 
developer, email me at dgstirling@yahoo.co.uk, see duncanstirling.com. During recent months I have been working with Laravel7, Angular.js and Vue.js. 

Code samples are taken directly from the project however much of the code from each sample has been removed to enable you to focus on the more interesting parts.
This project implements Laravel 7.11, Vue.js, Angular.js, JQuery, ES6, Bootstrap, CSS, MySQL and PHPUnit (test examples provided).

# ANGULAR.JS USAGE

Angular.js has been used to create dynamically generated menus when creating an advert. For example if a user wanted to place and advert in Texas, they would: 

1. select international
2. select USA from a list of international countries
3. select Texas from a list of American cities
