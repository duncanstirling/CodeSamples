                        LARAVEL CODE SAMPLE: USE OF ANGUAR.JS

Please note nearestnow.com is a work in progress, it is at prototype stage however basic functionality does work. If you would like to employ me as a full stack Laravel 
developer, email me at dgstirling@yahoo.co.uk, see duncanstirling.com. During recent months I have been working with Laravel7, Angular.js and Vue.js. 

Code samples are taken directly from the project however much of the code from each sample has been removed to enable you to focus on the more interesting parts.
This project implements Laravel 7.11, Vue.js, Angular.js, JQuery, ES6, Bootstrap, CSS, MySQL and PHPUnit (test examples provided).
-------------------------------------------------------------
# PHPUnit

php artisan make:test UserTest
# or

php artisan make:test UserTest --unit
# depending on if I want it to go into the Unit or Feature directory, then

php artisan test
